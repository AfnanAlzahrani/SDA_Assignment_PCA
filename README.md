> * Closely related to feature engineering is the concept of dimensionality reduction. How many features are too many features? Is there even such a thing as too many features? Believe it or not, in Machine Learning there is a phenomenon known as “the curse of dimensionality”. Maybe there are literally too many dimensions to the data, at least considering the speed we need for modeling. Another example, beyond modeling, is if we just want to visualize our data, if the data is three-dimensional, it can be made two-dimensional so that it is easier to demonstrate. The most commonly used technique to reduce the dimensionality of data is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). By using PCA we can reduce the dimensionality of our data in order to increase the performance of our models.
